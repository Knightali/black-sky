        # It Has TWO TYPES

                    # OPENING A FILE 
            # Python has open() Function for opening a file. It takes 2 Parementers FileName and Mode
                    # open("File Name","Mode")
                # Open is a Built-in-Function in Python
                # There Are three Types of Mode:
                    # 1. Read Mode(r)
                    # 2. Write Mode(w)
                    # 3. Append Mode(a)
                    # 3. Update Mode(+)
